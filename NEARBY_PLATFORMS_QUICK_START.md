## Color Meanings

- 🟢 **Green** = On Time (Train is on schedule)
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Delayed (Train is running late)
- 🔴 **Red** = Cancelled (Train is not running)

---

## Platform Distance Explained

```
You are at Platform 2

Train on Platform 1 → Distance = 1 away
Train on Platform 2 → Distance = 0 away (Your platform!)
Train on Platform 3 → Distance = 1 away
Train on Platform 4 → Distance = 2 away
```

**Tip:** Lower distance = closer to you!

---

## Common Use Cases

### "I want to catch the nearest train"
1. Set **Platform Range** to 2
2. Look for **🟢 On Time** status
3. Find train with **Distance: 0** or **Distance: 1**
4. Navigate to that platform!

### "I want to see all trains at my junction"
1. Select **Platform Range** to 3-5
2. See up to 5 trains displayed
3. Compare their schedules
4. Choose your preferred train

### "I'm waiting for a specific train"
Use **🚂 Specific Train** mode instead (enter train number)

## Tips for Better Experience
